# Simple Web App Framework  

**Author: Sean Pesce**  

## Overview  

Python 3 framework I developed for quickly prototyping web apps (e.g., server emulators). This code is not considered safe for use on public hosts.  

## Usage  

The vast majority of common use-cases are demonstrated the example implementations in `endpoints.py` (generally speaking, most new code should be added to this file).  

## Disclaimer  

This code was not developed with security in mind, and likely contains vulnerabilities. For that reason, live implementations should never be exposed on a network for an extended period of time (if at all).

## License  

None yet.
